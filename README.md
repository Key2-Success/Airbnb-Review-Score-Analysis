## **Airbnb Review Score Analysis**

### **Background**
In this group project, we explored what renters look for when renting from Airbnb. As UCLA students, we chose to explore the LA dataset to glean insights on what a host could do to better her review score. A review score is value from 0 to 100 that represents the overall experience of the renter. For my part, I chose to look into which attributes and amenities contribute to a significant change in review score rating by running linear regression models on transformed data.
